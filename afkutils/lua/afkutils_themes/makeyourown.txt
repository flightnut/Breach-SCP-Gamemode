To make your own theme just copy and paste the template below into a new file called "themename.lua". You can change "themename" to whatever you want to call the theme.

Copy "template.lua" to the same directory
Rename "template.lua" to whatever you want to call your theme (Example: cooltheme.lua)
Open that file and read the comments
Done

I will be realeasing a theme pack on scriptfodder some day, so stay tuned for that.
